----------------------------------------
plans for twitch integration:
make an array at 803f0000 that holds 4 byte timers for every effect, sorted by ID
make an array that holds prior timers at 803f0400
the effects that trigger on activation do stuff once the new timer is bigger than the old timer

program frontend:
make the streamer able to put a "base chaos frequency". this has to be put in seconds. recommended number: 5-10 (higher number: easier). write this number to 803F0800
make the streamer able to put a "base chaos duration". this has to be put in seconds. recommended number: 30. write this number to 803F0804

add (effecttime(in seconds) multiplied by 30) to the number at 803F0000 + codeID*4
just write 30 for the effects that have no timer
